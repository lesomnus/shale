// Command shale is a payday app.
//
// What to read first is `cmd/serve.go`: it is the stack, written out, and it is
// the whole of what this app says to stand up a served, migrated, walled
// server. `cli` is the command line over it, and is a package of its own so
// that what only a process needs -- the database engine, the migration engine
// -- is not linked into a sandbox that needs neither.
